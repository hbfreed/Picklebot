# Picklebot: Computer Vision for Balls and Strikes
## Overview
We present Picklebot, an automated umpire to call balls and strikes in baseball using mobile architectures, including MobileNetV3, MoViNet and (eventually) MobileViT V1 & V2.

## Demo
See the demo on [huggingface](https://huggingface.co/spaces/hbfreed/picklebot_demo) to try Picklebot out!

## Dataset
See the Picklebot dataset on [huggingface](https://huggingface.co/datasets/hbfreed/Picklebot-50K).

## What's in the pipeline?
Soon, training will start on some subset of [Picklebot-2M](https://huggingface.co/datasets/hbfreed/Picklebot-2M). With the new dataset, we will be able to do more granular classification for the pitches, like pitch location or type of pitch (fourseam fastball, curveball, etc.).
