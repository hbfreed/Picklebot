# Picklebot: Computer Vision for Balls and Strikes
## Overview
We present Picklebot, an automated umpire to call balls and strikes in baseball using mobile architectures, including MobileNetV3 and (eventually) MobileViT V1 & V2.

## Results

### MobileNet Small
So far, MobileNetV3-Small modified with 3D convolutions has produced 80% accuracy on the test set (see cloud_train.ipynb).
